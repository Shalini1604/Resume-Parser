# WHAT IS RESUME SCANNER? 


**The main objective of this Resume Scanner is to analyse the Resume of the student and comparing it with the company's requirments**
It was completely built on **Python**. The steps involved in Scanning the resume are explained below: 

- First the student needs to upload their Resume and the Resume which is in a **PDF** format is being converted into a **txt** file. 
- Now the text file is being scanned and the **keywords** from the file are being extracted. **key_phrases.py** analyses the whole file and 
  the important keywords are seperated out. Now the key words are given a Polarity value based on which the student is examined. 
- The Student's qualification is now being compared with the Company's **requirment**.
